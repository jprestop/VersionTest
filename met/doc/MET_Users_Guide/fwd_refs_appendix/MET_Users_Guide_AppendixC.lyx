This appendix provides specific information about the many verification
 statistics and measures that are computed by MET.
 These measures are categorized into measures for categorical (dichotomous)
 variables; measures for continuous variables; measures for probabilistic
 forecasts and measures for neighborhood methods.
 While the continuous, categorical, and probabilistic statistics are computed
 by both the Point-Stat and Grid-Stat tools, the neighborhood verification
 measures are only provided by the Grid-Stat tool.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The verification statistics for dichotomous variables are formulated using
 a contingency table such as the one shown in Table C-1.
 In this table f represents the forecasts and o represents the observations;
 the two possible forecast and observation values are represented by the
 values 0 and 1.
 The values in Table C-1 are counts of the number of occurrences of the
 four possible combinations of forecasts and observations.

 Similarly, if the counts are divided by the row (column) totals, conditional
 proportions, based on the forecasts (observations) can be computed.
 All of these combinations and the basic counts can be produced by the Point-Sta
t tool.

The values in Table C-1 can also be used to compute the F, O, and H relative
 frequencies that are produced by the NCEP Verification System, and the
 Point-Stat tool provides an option to produce the statistics in this form.
 In terms of the other statistics computed by the Point-Stat tool, F is
 equivalent to the Mean Forecast; H is equivalent to POD; and O is equivalent
 to the Base Rate.
 All of these statistics are defined in the subsections below.

 No cost is incurred if no protection is undertaken.
 Then, if the event occurs, the user sustains a loss.
 If the event does not occur, there is neither a cost nor a loss.
 The maximum forecast value is achieved when the cost/loss ratio equals
 the climatological probability.
 When this occurs, the

 The Economic Cost Loss Relative Value is defined differently depending
 on whether the cost / loss ratio is lower than the base rate or higher.
 The

Percentiles of the errors provide more information about the distribution
 of errors than can be obtained from the mean and standard deviations of
 the errors.
 Percentiles are computed by ordering the errors from smallest to largest
 and computing the rank location of each percentile in the ordering, and
 matching the rank to the actual value.
 Percentiles can also be used to create box plots of the errors.
 In MET, the 0.10th, 0.25th, 0.50th, 0.75th, and 0.90th quantile values of the
 errors are computed.

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The Anomaly correlation coefficient is equivalent to the Pearson correlation
 coefficient, except that both the forecasts and observations are first
 adjusted according to a climatology value.
 The anomaly is the difference between the individual forecast or observation
 and the typical situation, as measured by a climatology (
\series bold
c
\series default
) of some variety.
 It measures the strength of linear association between the forecast anomolies
 and observed anomalies.
 The Anomaly correlation coefficient is defined as:

Partial Sums lines (SL1L2, SAL1L2, VL1L2, VAL1L2) (Tables 4-11, 4-12, 4-13,
 and 4-14)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SL1L2, SAL1L2, VL1L2, and VAL1L2 line types are used to store data summaries
 (e.g.
 partial sums) that can later be accumulated into verification statistics.
 These are divided according to scalar or vector summaries (S or V).
 The climate anomaly values (A) can be stored in place of the actuals, which
 is just a recentering of the values around the climatological average.
 L1 and L2 refer to the L1 and L2 norms, the distance metrics commonly referred
 to as the “city block” and “Euclidean” distances.
 The city block is the absolute value of a distance while the Euclidean
 distance is the square root of the squared distance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The partial sums can be accumulated over individual cases to produce statistics
 for a longer period without any loss of information because these sums
 are 
\emph on
sufficient
\emph default
 for resulting statistics such as RMSE, bias, correlation coefficient, and
 MAE (Mood et al, 1974).
 Thus, the individual errors need not be stored, all of the information
 relevant to calculation of statistics are contained in the sums.
 As an example, the sum of all data points and the sum of all squared data
 points (or equivalently, the sample mean and sample variance) are 
\emph on
jointly sufficient
\emph default
 for estimates of the Gaussian distribution mean and variance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Minimally
\emph default
 sufficient statistics are those that condense the data most, with no loss
 of information.
 Statistics based on L1 and L2 norms allow for good compression of information.
 Statistics based on other norms, such as order statistics, do not result
 in good compression of information.
 For this reason, statistics such as RMSE are often preferred to statistics
 such as the median absolute deviation.
 The partial sums are not sufficient for order statistics, such as the median
 or quartiles.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The results of the probabilistic verification methods that are included
 in the Point-Stat, Grid-Stat, and Stat-Analysis tools are summarized using
 a variety of measures.
 MET treats probabilistic forecasts as categorical, divided into bins by
 user-defined thresholds between zero and one.
 For the categorical measures, if a forecast probability is specified in
 a formula, the mid-point value of the bin is used.
 These measures include the Brier Score (BS) with confidence bounds (Bradley
 2008); the joint distribution, calibration-refinement, likelihood-base
 rate (Wilks 2011); and receiver operating characteristic information.
 Using these statistics, reliability and discrimination diagrams can be
 produced.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The verification statistics for probabilistic forecasts of dichotomous variables
 are formulated using a contingency table such as the one shown in Table
 C-2.
 In this table f represents the forecasts and o represents the observations;
 the two possible forecast and observation values are represented by the
 values 0 and 1.
 The values in Table C-2 are counts of the number of occurrences of all
 possible combinations of forecasts and observations.

 This set of measures is paired with refinement in the calibration-refinement
 factorization discussed in Wilks (2011).
 A well-calibrated forecast will have calibration values that are near the
 forecast probability.
 For example, a 50% probability of precipitation should ideally have a calibrati
on value of 0.5.
 If the calibration value is higher, then the probability has been underestimate
d, and vice versa.

Likelihood 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Likelihood is the conditional probability for each forecast category (row)
 given an event and a component of the likelihood-base rate factorization;
 see Wilks (2011) for details.
 This set of measures considers the distribution of forecasts for only the
 cases when events occur.
 Thus, as the forecast probability increases, so should the likelihood.
 For example, 10% probability of precipitation forecasts should have a much
 smaller likelihood value than 90% probability of precipitation forecasts.

\begin_layout Standard

Likelihood values are also used to create "discrimination" plots that compare
 the distribution of forecast values for events to the distribution of forecast
 values for non-events.
 These plots show how well the forecasts categorize events and non-events.
 The distribution of forecast values for non-events can be derived from
 the POFD values computed by MET for the user-specified thresholds.

Reliability diagram 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The reliability diagram is a plot of the observed frequency of events versus
 the forecast probability of those events, with the range of forecast probabilit
ies divided into categories.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The ideal forecast (i.e., one with perfect reliability) has conditional observed
 probabilities that are equivalent to the forecast probability, on average.
 On a reliability plot, this equivalence is represented by the one-to-one
 line (the solid line in the figure below).
 So, better forecasts are closer to the diagonal line and worse ones are
 farther away.
 The distance of each point from the diagonal gives the conditional bias.
 Points that lie below the diagonal line indicate over-forecasting; in other
 words, the forecast probabilities are too large.
 The forecast probabilities are too low when the points lie above the line.
 The reliability diagram is conditioned on the forecasts so it is often
 used in combination with the ROC, which is conditioned on the observations,
 to provide a "complete" representation of the performance of probabilistic
 forecasts.

Receiver operating characteristic 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
MET produces hit rate (POD) and false alarm rate (POFD) values for each
 user-specified threshold.
 This information can be used to create a scatter plot of POFD vs.
 POD.
 When the points are connected, the plot is generally referred to as the
 receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (also called the "relative
 operating characteristic" curve).
 See the area under the ROC curve (AUC) entry for related information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
An ROC plot is shown for an example set of forecasts, with a solid line
 connecting the points for six user-specified thresholds (0.25, 0.35, 0.55,
 0.65, 0.75, 0.85).
 The diagonal dashed line indicates no skill while the dash-dot line shows
 the ROC for a perfect forecast.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
An ROC curve shows how well the forecast discriminates between two outcomes,
 so it is a measure of resolution.
 The ROC is invariant to linear transformations of the forecast, and is
 thus unaffected by bias.
 An unbiased (i.e., well-calibrated) forecast can have the same ROC as a biased
 forecast, though most would agree that an unbiased forecast is "better".
 Since the ROC is conditioned on the observations, it is often paired with
 the reliability diagram, which is conditioned on the forecasts.

Area Under the ROC curve (AUC)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is often
 used as a single summary measure.
 A larger AUC is better.
 A perfect forecast has AUC=1.
 Though the minimum value is 0, an AUC of 0.5 indicates no skill.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The area under the curve can be estimated in a variety of ways.
 In MET, the simplest trapezoid method is used to calculate the area.
 AUC is calculated from the series of hit rate (POD) and false alarm rate
 (POFD) values (see the ROC entry below) for each user-specified threshold.

CRPS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) is the integral, over all
 possible thresholds, of the Brier scores (Gneiting et al, 2004).
 In MET, the CRPS calculation uses a normal distribution fit to the ensemble
 forecasts.
 In many cases, use of other distributions would be better.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
WARNING: The normal distribution is probably a good fit for temperature
 and pressure, and possibly a not horrible fit for winds.
 However, the normal approximation will not work on most precipitation forecasts
 and may fail for many other atmospheric variables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Closed form expressions for the CRPS are difficult to define when using
 data rather than distribution functions.
 However, if a normal distribution can be assumed, then the following equation
 gives the CRPS for each individual observation (denoted by a lowercase
 crps) and the corresponding distribution of forecasts.

In this equation, the y represents the event threshold.
 The estimated mean and standard deviation of the ensemble forecasts (
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

) are used as the parameters of the normal distribution.
 The values of the normal distribution are represented by the probability
 density function (PDF) denoted by 
\backslash
phi and the cumulative distribution function (CDF), denoted in the above
 equation by 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The score can be interpreted as a continuous version of the mean absolute
 error (MAE).
 Thus, the score is negatively oriented, so smaller is better.
 Further, similar to MAE, bias will inflate the CRPS.
 Thus, bias should also be calculated and considered when judging forecast
 quality using CRPS.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
CRPS Skill Score
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The continuous ranked probability skill score (CRPSS) is similar to the
 MSESS and the BSS, in that it compares its namesake score to that of a
 reference forecast to produce a positively oriented score between 0 and
 1.

IGN
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The ignorance score (IGN) is the negative logarithm of a predictive probability
 density function (Gneiting et al, 2004).
 In MET, the IGN is calculated based on a normal approximation to the forecast
 distribution (i.e.
 a normal pdf is fit to the forecast values).
 This approximation may not be valid, especially for discontinuous forecasts
 like precipitation, and also for very skewed forecasts.
 For a single normal distribution

 with parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$

, the ignorance score is

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Accumulation of the ignorance score for many forecasts is via the average
 of individual ignorance scores.
 This average ignorance score is the value output by the MET software.
 Like many error statistics, the IGN is negatively oriented, so smaller
 numbers indicate better forecasts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
PIT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The probability integral transform (PIT) is the analog of the rank histogram
 for a probability distribution forecast (Dawid, 1984).
 Its interpretation is the same as that of the verification rank histogram:
 Calibrated probabilistic forecasts yield PIT histograms that are flat,
 or uniform.
 Underdispersed (not enough spread in the ensemble) forecasts have U-shaped
 PIT histograms while overdispersed forecasts have bell-shaped histograms.
 In MET, the PIT calculation uses a normal distribution fit to the ensemble
 forecasts.
 In many cases, use of other distributions would be better.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
RANK
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The rank of an observation, compared to all members of an ensemble forecast,
 is a measure of dispersion of the forecasts (Hamill, 2001).
 When ensemble forecasts possesses the same amount of variability as the
 corresponding observations, then the rank of the observation will follow
 a discrete uniform distribution.
 Thus, a rank histogram will be approximately flat.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The rank histogram does not provide information about the accuracy of ensemble
 forecasts.
 Further, examination of "rank" only makes sense for ensembles of a fixed
 size.
 Thus, if ensemble members are occasionally unavailable, the rank histogram
 should not be used.
 The PIT may be used instead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
SPREAD
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The ensemble spread for a single observation is the standard deviation of
 the ensemble member forecast values at that location.
 When verifying against point observations, these values are written to
 the ENS_SPREAD column of the Observation Rank (ORANK) line type.
 The ensemble spread computed over a spatial masking region is the average
 of the spread values for all observations falling within the mask.
 These values are written to the SPREAD column of the Ranked Histogram (RHIST)
 line type.

The Asymptotic Fractions Brier Score (AFBS) is a special case of the Fractions

The Uniform Fractions Skill Score (AFBS) is a reference statistic for the
 Fractions Skill score based on a uniform distribution of the total forecast
 events across the grid.
 This no-skill forecast defines the UFSS, and thus a skilled forecast must
 have a higher value of FSS than the UFSS.
 Again, the formula is the same as for FSS as above, the forecast proportion
 in each neighborhood is the same, and is equivalent to the overall forecast
 event proportion.

Several of the MET tools make use of percentiles in one way or another.
 Percentiles can be used as part of the internal computations of a tool,

 There are several widely-used conventions for calculating percentiles however,
 so in this secion we describe how percentiles are calculated in MET.
