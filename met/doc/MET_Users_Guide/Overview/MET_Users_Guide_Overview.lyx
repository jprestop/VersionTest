The goal of this User's Guide is to provide basic information for users
 of the Model Evaluation Tools (MET) to enable them to apply MET to their
 datasets and evaluation studies.
 MET was originally designed for application to the post-processed output
 of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (see 
\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://www.wrf-model.org/index.php
\end_layout

 for more information about the WRF).
 However, MET may also be used for the evaluation of forecasts from other
 models or applications if certain file format definitions (described in
 this document) are followed.

The Developmental Testbed Center (DTC)
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

MET has been developed, and will be maintained and enhanced, by the Developmenta
l Testbed Center (DTC; 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://www.dtcenter.org/
\end_layout

\end_inset

 ).
 The main goal of the DTC is to serve as a bridge between operations and
 research, to facilitate the activities of these two important components
 of the numerical weather prediction (NWP) community.
 The DTC provides an environment that is functionally equivalent to the
 operational environment in which the research community can test model
 enhancements; the operational community benefits from DTC testing and evaluatio
n of models before new models are implemented operationally.
 MET serves both the research and operational communities in this way -
 offering capabilities for researchers to test their own enhancements to
 models and providing a capability for the DTC to evaluate the strengths
 and weaknesses of advances in NWP prior to operational implementation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The MET package will also be available to DTC visitors and to the WRF modeling
 community for testing and evaluation of new model capabilities, applications
 in new environments, and so on.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The primary goal of MET development is to provide a state-of-the-art verificatio
n package to the NWP community.
 By "state-of-the-art" we mean that MET will incorporate newly developed
 and advanced verification methodologies, including new methods for diagnostic
 and spatial verification and new techniques provided by the verification
 and modeling communities.
 MET also utilizes and replicates the capabilities of existing systems for
 verification of NWP forecasts.
 For example, the MET package replicates existing National Center for Environmen
tal Prediction (NCEP) operational verification capabilities (e.g., I/O, methods,
 statistics, data types).
 MET development will take into account the needs of the NWP community -
 including operational centers and the research and development community.
 Some of the MET capabilities include traditional verification approaches
 for standard surface and upper air variables (e.g., Equitable Threat Score,
 Mean Squared Error), confidence intervals for verification measures, and
 spatial forecast verification methods.
 In the future, MET will include additional state-of-the-art and new methodologi
es.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The MET package has been designed to be modular and adaptable.
 For example, individual modules can be applied without running the entire
 set of tools.
 New tools can easily be added to the MET package due to this modular design.
 In addition, the tools can readily be incorporated into a larger "system"
 that may include a database as well as more sophisticated input/output
 and user interfaces.
 Currently, the MET package is a set of tools that can easily be applied
 by any user on their own computer platform.
 A suite of Python scripts for low-level automation of verification workflows
 and plotting has been developed to assist users with setting up their MET-based
 verification.
 It is called METplus and may be obtained at

The major components of the MET package are represented in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Fig_Overview_MET_Overview_Flowchart"

\end_inset

.
 The main stages represented are input, reformatting, plotting, intermediate
 output, statistical analyses, and output and aggregation/analysis.
 The MET-TC package functions independently of the other MET modules, as
 inducated in the Figure.
 Each of these stages is described further in later chapters.
 For example, the input and output formats are discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:MET-Data-I/O"

\end_inset

 as well as in the chapters associated with each of the statistics modules.
 MET input files are represented on the far left.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The reformatting stage of MET consists of the Gen-Vx-Mask, PB2NC, ASCII2NC,
 Pcp-Combine, MADIS2NC, MODIS regrid, WWMCA Regrid, and Ensemble-Stat tools.
 The PB2NC tool is used to create NetCDF files from input PrepBufr files
 containing point observations.
 Likewise, the ASCII2NC tool is used to create NetCDF files from input ASCII
 point observations.
 Many types of data from the MADIS network can be formatted for use in MET
 by the MADIS2NC tool.
 MODIS and WWMCA files are regridded and formatted into NetCDF files by
 their respective tools.
 These NetCDF files are then used in the statistical analysis step.
 The Gen-Vx-Mask and Pcp-Combine tools are optional.
 The Gen-Vx-Mask tool will create a bitmapped masking area in a variety
 of ways.
 The output mask can then be used to efficiently limit verification to the
 interior of a user specified region.
 The Pcp-Combine tool can be used to add, subtract, or derive fields across
 multiple timesteps.
 Often it is run to accumulate precipitation amounts into the time interval
 selected by the user - if a user would like to verify over a different
 time interval than is included in their forecast or observational dataset.
 The Ensemble-Stat tool will combine many forecasts into an ensemble mean
 or probability forecast.
 Additionally, if gridded or point observations are included, ensemble verificat
ion statistics are produced.

Several optional plotting utilities are provided to assist users in checking
 their output from the data preprocessing step.
 Plot-Point-Obs creates a postscript plot showing the locations of point
 observations.
 This can be quite useful for assessing whether the latitude and longitude
 of observation stations was specified correctly.
 Plot-Data-Plane produces a similar plot for gridded data.
 For users of the MODE object based verification methods, the Plot-MODE-Field
 utility will create graphics of the MODE object output.
 Finally, WWMCA-Plot produces a plot of the raw WWMCA data file.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The main statistical analysis components of the current version of MET are:
 Point-Stat, Grid-Stat, Series-Analysis, Ensemble-Stat, MODE, MODE-TD (MTD),
 and Wavelet-Stat.
 The Point-Stat tool is used for grid-to-point verification, or verification
 of a gridded forecast field against a point-based observation (i.e., surface
 observing stations, ACARS, rawinsondes, and other observation types that
 could be described as a point observation).
 In addition to providing traditional forecast verification scores for both
 continuous and categorical variables, confidence intervals are also produced
 using parametric and non-parametric methods.
 Confidence intervals take into account the uncertainty associated with
 verification statistics due to sampling variability and limitations in
 sample size.
 These intervals provide more meaningful information about forecast performance.
 For example, confidence intervals allow credible comparisons of performance
 between two models when a limited number of model runs is available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Sometimes it may be useful to verify a forecast against gridded fields (e.g.,
 Stage IV precipitation analyses).
 The Grid-Stat tool produces traditional verification statistics when a
 gridded field is used as the observational dataset.
 Like the Point-Stat tool, the Grid-Stat tool also produces confidence intervals.
 The Grid-Stat tool also includes "neighborhood" spatial methods, such as
 the Fractional Skill Score (Roberts and Lean 2008).
 These methods are discussed in Ebert (2008).
 The Grid-Stat tool accumulates statistics over the entire domain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Users wishing to accumulate statistics over a time, height, or other series
 separately for each grid location should use the Series-Analysis tool.
 Series-Analysis can read any gridded matched pair data produced by the
 other MET tools and accumulate them, keeping each spatial location separate.
 Maps of these statistics can be useful for diagnosing spatial differences
 in forecast quality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The MODE (Method for Object-based Diagnostic Evaluation) tool also uses
 gridded fields as observational datasets.
 However, unlike the Grid-Stat tool, which applies traditional forecast
 verification techniques, MODE applies the object-based spatial verification
 technique described in Davis et al.
 (2006a,b) and Brown et al.
 (2007).
 This technique was developed in response to the "double penalty" problem
 in forecast verification.
 A forecast missed by even a small distance is effectively penalized twice
 by standard categorical verification scores: once for missing the event
 and a second time for producing a false alarm of the event elsewhere.
 As an alternative, MODE defines objects in both the forecast and observation
 fields.
 The objects in the forecast and observation fields are then matched and
 compared to one another.
 Applying this technique also provides diagnostic verification information
 that is difficult or even impossible to obtain using traditional verification
 measures.
 For example, the MODE tool can provide information about errors in location,
 size, and intensity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The MODE-TD tool extends object-based analysis from two-dimensional forecasts
 and observations to include the time dimension.
 In addition to the two dimensional information provded by MODE, MODE-TD
 can be used to examine even more features including displacement in time,
 and duration and speed of moving areas of interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The Wavelet-Stat tool decomposes two-dimensional forecasts and observations
 according to the Intensity-Scale verification technique described by Casati
 et al.
 (2004).
 There are many types of spatial verification approaches and the Intensity-Scale
 technique belongs to the scale-decomposition (or scale-separation) verification
 approaches.
 The spatial scale components are obtained by applying a wavelet transformation
 to the forecast and observation fields.
 The resulting scale-decomposition measures error, bias and skill of the
 forecast on each spatial scale.
 Information is provided on the scale dependency of the error and skill,
 on the no-skill to skill transition scale, and on the ability of the forecast
 to reproduce the observed scale structure.
 The Wavelet-Stat tool is primarily used for precipitation fields.
 However, the tool can be applied to other variables, such as cloud fraction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though Ensemble-Stat is a preprocessing tool for creation of ensemble forecasts
 from a group of files, it also produces several types of ensemble statistics.
 Thus, it is included as a statistics tool in the flowchart.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Results from the statistical analysis stage are output in ASCII, NetCDF
 and Postscript formats.
 The Point-Stat, Grid-Stat, and Wavelet-Stat tools create STAT (statistics)
 files which are tabular ASCII files ending with a ".stat" suffix.
 In earlier versions of MET, this output format was called VSDB (Verification
 System DataBase).
 VSDB, which was developed by the NCEP, is a specialized ASCII format that
 can be easily read and used by graphics and analysis software.
 The STAT output format of the Point-Stat, Grid-Stat, and Wavelet-Stat tools
 is an extension of the VSDB format developed by NCEP.
 Additional columns of data and output line types have been added to store
 statistics not produced by the NCEP version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The Stat-Analysis and MODE-Analysis tools aggregate the output statistics
 from the previous steps across multiple cases.
 The Stat-Analysis tool reads the STAT output of Point-Stat, Grid-Stat,
 Ensemble-Stat, and Wavelet-Stat and can be used to filter the STAT data
 and produce aggregated continuous and categorical statistics.
 The MODE-Analysis tool reads the ASCII output of the MODE tool and can
 be used to produce summary information about object location, size, and
 intensity (as well as other object characteristics) across one or more
 cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tropical cyclone forecasts and observations are quite different than numerical
 model forecasts, and thus they have their own set of tools.
 The MET-TC package includes three modules: TC-DLAND, TC-PAIRS, and TC-STAT.
 The TC-DLAND module calculates the distance to land from all locations
 on a specified grid.
 This information can be used in later modules to eliminate tropical cyclones
 that are over land from being included in the statistics.
 TC-PAIRS matches up tropical cyclone forecasts and observations and writes
 all output to a file.
 In TC-STAT, these forecast / observation pairs are analyzed according to
 user preference to produce statistics.

Fortify
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the previous release of MET, requirements from various government
 agencies that use MET have resulted in our code being analyzed by Fortify,
 a proprietary static source code analyzer owned by HP Enterprise Security
 Products.
 Briefly, Fortify looks at source code and analyzes it for security risks,
 memory leaks, uninitialized variables, and other such weaknesses and bad
 coding practices.
 Fortify categorizes any issues it finds as low priority, high priority,
 or critical, and reports these issues back to the developers for them to
 address.
 A development cycle is thus established, with Fortify analyzing code and
 reporting back to the developers, who then make changes in the source code
 to address these issues, and hand the new code off to Fortify again for
 re-analysis.
 The goal is to drive the counts of both high priority and critical issues
 down to zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MET developers are pleased to report that after several months of work
 we have achieved this goal.
 Fortify now reports 
\shape italic
zero
\shape default
 high priority or critical issues in the MET code.
 Users of MET tools who work in high security environments can therefore
 rest assured about the possibility of security risks when using MET, since
 the quality of the code has now been vetted by unbiased third-party experts.
 The MET developers plan to continue using Fortify regularly to ensure that
 these counts remain at zero in all future releases.
