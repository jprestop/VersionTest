Fuzzy Logic Algorithm 
Fuzzy Logic is system of logic in which a
statement can be true (1), false (0), or any of the values in
between. A fuzzy logic 
{\italicfont algorithm}
uses a set of weighted
functions to produce a value between 0 and 1. In MODE, the
functions and weights are chosen by the user. The ``interest''
value produced by the algorithm typically compares how well
two items correspond to each other in terms of the attributes
used in the functions or interest maps. For example, two objects
may correspond very well 
(\ie,~have a total interest value close to 1)
if their boundary distance is 0.
// (\ie,~they overlap).
