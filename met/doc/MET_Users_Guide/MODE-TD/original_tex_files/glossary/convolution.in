Convolution
A two-dimensional smoothing operation used on input forecast
and observation fields to reduce the effect of noise on subsequent
steps of object identification. ``Smoother'' is a generic name for
any of a 
variety of techniques that can be used to either remove undesired
high-spatial-frequency data points (\eg,~locations of rapid variation,
such as noise contamination), or to resample dependent variable
values to other independent variable locations using the values
of the data at nearby points.

   //  this part isn't quite right
   //

// In MODE, convolution is applied
// via distance-weighted averaging of all points within a specified
// radius of each target point, i.e. it is a circular weighted
// mean smoother. The weight of each point is proportional to
// the square of its distance from the target location.

   //  my old definition

// Essentially a smoothing operation.
// MODE uses a convolution filter to produce
// a weighted average of the raw field values
// near a point.
