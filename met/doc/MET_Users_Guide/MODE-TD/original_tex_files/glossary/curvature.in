Curvature
The curvature of a curve at a point measures the
extent to which the curve deviates from a straight
line near the point.  This can be obtained by determining
the circle that best fits the curve near the point (called
the {\italicfont osculating circle}).  The curvature 
is defined to be the reciprocal of the radius of the 
fitted circle.
