Grid
In MODE (and more generally in MET) 
atmospheric grids are represented internally 
as the composition of a basic map projection and an
affine transformation of the $xy$ plane.
Often it is convenient to pretend that grids
have real-valued $x$ and $y$ coordinates, so that
we can use $x$ and $y$ as a coordinate 
system on that region of the Earth covered by the grid.
However, since we only have data values
at integer values of $x$ and $y$, for many purposes
we regard grids merely as subsets of $\Z \times \Z$.
