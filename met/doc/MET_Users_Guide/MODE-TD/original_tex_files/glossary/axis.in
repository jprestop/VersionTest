Axis
A line associated to an object giving information on
the spatial orientation of the object.
MODE outputs the axis angle, which gives the inclination of the
axis line to the $x$ grid direction.
Since the axis line always passes through the centroid of the 
given object, this angle (along with the location of
the centroid ) suffices to determine the axis line.
