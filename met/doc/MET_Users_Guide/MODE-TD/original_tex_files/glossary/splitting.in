Splitting

The process by which the connectedness of each (grid)point
to other points is determined. Points that are connected form
simple objects. Points that are not connected are contained
within different simple objects. See 
illust_number(splitting_fig) 
on page~illust_page_number(splitting_fig)
for an illustration. 
Essentially, splitting is the process of distinguishing
objects from one another and from the surrounding empty
grid space.
