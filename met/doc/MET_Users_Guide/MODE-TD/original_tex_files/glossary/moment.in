Moment
The sum 
// (or, in some cases, integral) 
of some scalar quantity over an object.
For example, the first $x$ moment $S_x$ is the
sum  of values of the $x$ coordinate over the object.
Sometimes the origin of the coordinate system
is translated to the centroid of the object
before the moment is calculated, in
which case the moment is called
a {\italicfont central} moment.
