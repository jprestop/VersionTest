The next category of spatial attributes is for pairs of 
objects --- one of the pair coming from the collection
of forecast objects, the other coming from the observation
objects.

\par

Note: whenever a pair attribute is described below as a 
{\italicfont delta}, that means it's a simple difference of
two single-object attributes.  The difference is always
taken as ``forecast minus observed.''

\par

The {\boldfont spatial centroid distance} is 
the purely spatial part of the centroid separation of two
objects.  If one centroid is at 
$(\overline{x}_1, \overline{y}_1, \overline{t}_1)$
and the other is at
$(\overline{x}_2, \overline{y}_2, \overline{t}_2)$
then the distance is calculated as

$$

\sqrt{

   \left(\overline{x}_1 - \overline{x}_2\right)^2

    +

   \left(\overline{y}_1 - \overline{y}_2\right)^2

}

$$


\indent 
The {\boldfont time centroid delta} is the difference
between the time coordinates of the centroid.  Since this
is a simple difference, it can be either positive or negative.

\par

The {\boldfont axis difference} is smaller of the two angles
that the two spatial axis planes make with each other.
// For example, in illust_number(axis_diff_fig), the axis difference is
// the angle $ \ADSmall $, not $ \ADLarge $.

\par

{\boldfont Speed delta} and
{\boldfont direction difference} are obtained from the 
velocity vectors of the two objects.
Speed delta is the difference in the lengths of the vectors, 
and direction difference is the angle that the two vectors
make with each other.

\par

{\boldfont Volume ratio} is volume of the forecast 
object divided by the volume of the observed object.
Note that any 3D object must necessarily have a nonzero 
volume, so there's no chance of zeros in the
denominator.

\par

{\boldfont Start time delta}
and
{\boldfont end time delta}
are the differences in the corresponding times associated with
the two objects.

\par

{\boldfont Intersection volume} measures the overlap of two objects.
If the two objects do not overlap, then this will be zero.

\par

Finally, the {\boldfont total interest} gives the result of the
fuzzy-logic matching and merging calculation for this pair of
objects.  Note that this is provided only for simple objects, 
not for composites.
