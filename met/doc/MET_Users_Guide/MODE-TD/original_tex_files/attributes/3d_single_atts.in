MTD calculates several 3D attributes for single objects.
The object could come from either the forecast field
or the observed field.

\par

A 3D spacetime {\boldfont centroid}  
$(\overline{x}, \overline{y}, \overline{t})$
is calculated. There are no statistical overtones here.
The number $\overline{x}$, for example, is just the average
value of the $x$ coordinate over the object.

// \vskip SKIP_AMT
\par

The vector {\boldfont velocity} 
$(v_x, v_y)$
is obtained by fitting a 
line to an 3D object.  The requirement for fitting the 
line is to minimize the sum of the squares of the
{\italicfont spatial} distances from each point of the
object to the line be minimized.
(We can't measure distances in spacetime but at each
fixed time $t$ we can measure purely spatial distances.)
From this velocity we get the {\boldfont speed} and
{\boldfont direction} of movement of the object.

The spatial orientation of a object (what traditional
MODE calls the {\boldfont axis angle} of an object)
is gotten by fitting a plane to an object.
As with the case of velocity, our optimization criterion
is that the sum of the squares of the 
spatial distances from each point
of the object to the plane be minimized.

\par

illust_number(axis_3d_fig) gives some idea of the
reason for fitting a plane, rather than a line, as MODE does.
On the left in the figure, 
we see an object (in \ObjectColor, shaped like an ``\LetterShape'')
at several time steps moving through the grid.
For simplicity, the object is not rotating as it moves 
(though of course real objects can certainly do this).
At each time step, the 2D MODE spatial axis of the object is
indicated by the \AxisColor\ line.

In the center of the figure, we see the same thing, just with
more time steps.  And on the right, even more time steps.
We see that the axis lines at each time step
sweep out a plane in three dimensions, shown in 
\AxisColor\ on the right.
This plane is the same one that MTD would calculate 
for this 3D object to determine its spatial orientation, 
\ie, axis angle.  Indeed, for the special case of an object
that is not moving at all, the MTD calculation of 
axis angle reduces to the same one that traditional 
MODE uses, as it should.

\par

A simple integer count of the number of grid squares in an object 
for all of it's lifetime gives the {\boldfont volume} of the object.
Remember that while we're working in three dimensions, one of
the dimensions is non-spatial, so one should not attempt to
convert this to a volume in, \eg, ${\hbox{km}}^3$.

\par

The {\boldfont start time} and {\boldfont end time} of an object
are attributes as well.  This is an integer telling which time
step an object starts and ends at.  These values are zero-based, so
for example, 
if an object comes into existence at the 
do_ordinal(3) 
time step and lasts until the 
do_ordinal(9) 
time step, then the start time 
and end time will be listed as 2 and 8, respectively.
Note that this object has a lifetime of 7 time steps, not 6.

\par

Finally, MTD calculates several 
{\boldfont intensity percentiles} 
of the raw data values inside each object.
Not all of the the attributes are purely geometrical.
