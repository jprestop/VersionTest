The formats for two-dimensional data files used as input to MTD 
are the same ones supported by most of the MET tools.  
Generally speaking, if MODE can use a forecast or
observation data file as input, then that file can also be
used by MTD.  The only difference is that while MODE 
// (and most of the other MET tools) 
takes only one forecast and one observed data file
as input, MTD takes a series of files.

\par

As shown in the next section, filenames for each time used must 
be given.  Thus, for example, if MTD is being used for verification 
over a period of 24 hours, and the data file valid times are 
separated by one hour, then a total of 48 filenames must be 
specified on the MTD command line --- 24 filenames for the 
forecast files, and 24
for the observation files.  Further, the filenames must be given
in order of increasing valid time.  Many users will prefer to write
scripts to automate this, rather than type in a lengthy 
command line by hand.

\Comment{We were also considering enabling the user to specify a 
file that had the data filenames in it, right?}
